# Week 2: Web Design Process, Tools, and Principles

## What we'll be building in this course:
Before we really dig into writing code, let's talk about the process of designing a website: from idea to fully realized site. As a group we'll go through each step of the process, and the designs that we create will serve as a foundation for your individual projects.

There are a few different directions we can go with these projects, but here are a few suggestions to get your creative juices flowing:

### Useful Templates
Choose something that you think would be a useful tool, that maybe other people would use/find interesting if it had real, dynamic data included.
- A blog: design a personal or professional blog. Questions to consider may be: how to handle a featured post, list view vs grid view, data included in each post (author, date, title, topics), styling of an individual post once it's expanded, how to display archived posts, etc. 
- A weather site: design a site to display the weather. Questions to consider may be: what data to emphasize, how to display changes over time, how to handle location, etc.
- A music library:

### Art
Choose a theme or topic as a group, then individually explore different layouts and approaches. Start with simple shapes (a la 8-bit block art), and as the course progresses add in more sophistication (curves, svg shapes, animations, etc). At the end of the course we can create a site for the class where each that links to each individual art board.
- The Chicago skyline: create a realistic or abstract view of the city skyline. Put emphasis on different buildings, natural things, signs, etc.
- Outer space: create the solar system, a scene on a particular planet, earth, etc.
- Recreate famous art: build the Mona Lisa, The Great Wave, American Gothic, etc in HTML & CSS.
- A house: get as detailed as you like and create your dream house or your childhood home.
- A nature scene: create a forest with animals, an ocean scene, a mountain range.

### Redesign a Live Website
There are lots of sites that would benefit quite a bit from a redesign: choose one or a few as a group and put your own spin on it. Discuss what they do well, what content is important to keep and what can be removed, how other sites in that space handle things differently.
