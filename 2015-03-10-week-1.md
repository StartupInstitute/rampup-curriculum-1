# RampUp: Week 1: A Brief Introduction to The Web

## Let's set up our machines:
1. Install your text-editor ([Atom](https://atom.io/) or [Sublime](http://www.sublimetext.com/)) — both are good options. Sublime is an industry favorite, and Atom is a newcomer developed by Github (and is open source!).
2. Download [Google Chrome](http://www.google.com/chrome/) — ultimately you'll want to test your sites on all major browsers (Firefox, IE, Safari, Mobile Safari, etc), but for development we recommend Chrome so we're all using the same web inspector.
3. Create a Development folder in the home directory of your computer. On a Mac, you can navigate to your home directory by right-clicking the title at the top of a Finder window, and selecting your username. On a PC, your home directory equivalent is the C drive. This is the folder where you can keep all your various web development projects, rather than cluttering up your desktop or documents.
4. Sign up for [Slack](https://slack.com/) in the group set up by your instructor. Slack is an excellent tool for group communication, and can be used in RampUp for general announcements, questions, and discussion.

## A little context:

### How does a website actually work?
![](/img/overview.png)
Above is a basic diagram of what's happening behind the scenes of a live website. The process is typically some variation of this:
- The URL (or domain name) you type into a browser is mapped to some type of web hosting solution, which can be broken up into two broad categories: static hosts and dynamic web servers. Of the hosts depicted above, Github Pages (free) and Amazon S3 (very cheap) are static — meaning they are perfect for simple websites (e.g. a small personal site, a splash page for a product, etc). If you are building a site with more dynamic content (e.g. a CMS like Wordpress, a web application, etc) you would likely need a web server through a service like Amazon EC2 or Rackspace (quite expensive over time).
- When the browser pings your web host, it receives all of the files stored there (HTML & CSS documents, images, etc), interprets them, and renders the page as you see it.

### Content, Presentation, and Behavior

There are three primary types of documents that go into the making of a static website: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In the early days of the web, before the introduction of CSS, styles were written inline in HTML tags.

...

### HTML

HTML (hypertext markup language) contains the structure and content of a web page. An HTML document is broken up into two parts: the head and the body. Imagine these two as sections of a house:

![](/img/house.png)

The head is the attic: while there are important things stored away up there, no its contents are invisible to visitors of the house. Everything within the body tags, however, is the visible content of the web page — the elements seen by visitors. The head may contain links to CSS documents, meta tags, the page title, etc — whereas the body contains visible elements like images, headinigs, paragraphs, hyperlinks, videos, and so on.

### CSS

CSS (cascading style sheets) contains the style rules defined for a page. Within CSS rules you can specify rules for HTML elements by using selectors. Selectors may be tag names (p, a, div, etc.), classes, or IDs (more on those later). After specifying which selector to target, you define various style rules (color, size, position, etc) within curly braces.

### JavaScript

JavaScript is a programming language primarily used to manipulate content on a web page (trigger an event when a user clicks a button, iterate through an image carousel, send data from an HTML form to a web server), though recently it has also become fairly common to see it used as a server-side language (say, to create a web app using Node.js). We will not delve much into JavaScript in this class, though if there is time we will experiment with triggering simple events on click of a button, or things to that effect.

### File Hierarchy

    .
    ├── index.html
    ├── css
    |   ├── style.css
    ├── img
    |   ├── banner.jpg
    |   └── logo.svg
    |	└── graphic.png
    ├── js
    |   ├── main.js
    |   └── slider.js

### Document Structure
    
HTML:    

      <!DOCTYPE html>
      <html>
          <head>
              <title>My Website</title>
              <meta charset="utf-8">
              <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/style.css">
          </head>
          <body>
              <h1>Hello World</h1>
              <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script>
              <script type="text/javascript" src="js/main.js"></script>
          </body>
      </html>

CSS:

		body{
        	background-color: blue;
            font-size: 10px;
        }
        p,a{
        	font-size: 1.6rem;
        }
        h1{
        	font-size: 2.2rem;
            font-weight: 600;
        }

JS:

		$('.button').on('click', function(){
        	alert('Hello world!');
        });
